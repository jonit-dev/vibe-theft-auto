# Game Engine Modules Overview

This document provides an overview of the modular architecture of the game engine. The engine is divided into self-contained modules, each responsible for a specific subsystem.

## Module Structure

The engine is organized into the following modules:

- **Rendering**: Graphics rendering system
- **Resources**: Asset loading and management
- **Input**: User input handling (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- **Physics**: Physics simulation and collision detection
- **Audio**: Sound and music playback
- **Events**: Event system for communication between components

## Directory Organization

```
src/
└── modules/
    ├── rendering/   # Graphics rendering system
    ├── resources/   # Asset loading and management
    ├── input/       # User input handling
    ├── physics/     # Physics simulation
    ├── audio/       # Sound and music playback
    └── events/      # Event communication system
```

## Module Guidelines

When working with modules:

1. Keep all related code within the module directory
2. Define clear interfaces for communication with other modules
3. Use dependency injection for cross-module dependencies
4. Minimize direct dependencies between modules

## Dependency Management

Modules should communicate through well-defined interfaces and dependency injection. This approach:

1. Reduces coupling between subsystems
2. Makes the code more testable
3. Enables easier replacement of implementations
4. Improves maintainability

## Adding New Modules

To add a new module to the engine:

1. Create a new directory under `src/modules/`
2. Add the module documentation under `docs/modules/`
3. Register module services in the dependency injection container
4. Define clear interfaces for communication with other modules
